## Introduction

This assignment requires programmers to implement and test a software
of your choice. Specifically, the project must solve a problem and/or
use or develop a software tool related to compilers. The
implementation can be written in a programming language of the developer's
choosing.

The project repository must contain:

* README that describes the tools and languages used and outlines the steps for successful run of 	your software.
* `/writing` directory containing all writing documents pertaining to the project.
* `/src` directory containing all source programs.
* `/test` directory containing all test programs.
* `/output` directory containing sample output.

A carefully formatted assignment sheet for the final project provides more details
about the steps that a computer scientist should take to complete this
assignment. You can view this assignment sheet by visiting the course web site.
